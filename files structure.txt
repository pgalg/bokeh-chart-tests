bokeh automatically refers to css and js file on a remote server (pydata.org)
(js = interactions between objects, css = styling)

It is also possible to store these on your own server
this can be done by specifying the attribute mode in output_file.

mode='relative' --> the css and js file is stored in the bokeh directory (within python)
mode='absolute'--> same thing but with an absolute path (C:\...)
mode='inline' --> the whole js is loaded in the html output file
mode='cdn' is the standard format

output_file("bokeh_plot.html", mode="cdn"
